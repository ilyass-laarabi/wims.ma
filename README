         Distribution version 4.21e of WIMS
	  (WWW Interactive Multipurpose Server)


Please be aware that WIMS is a sophisticated software, not a simple set of
web pages. You have to compile and install it if you want to run it locally
on your computer.

WIMS is copyrighted under the GNU General Public License (GPL). See the file
COPYING for licensing conditions.

This software is reported to work on several Linux distributions, including
Red Hat, Debian, and LinuxPPC. It is also reported to work on Mac OS-X and
should work on any modern Unix-like system after minimal porting efforts.

You may compile the system on your machine. You can use a chroot for the third party
support softwares or use the locally installed ones.

#######################

Here are the steps for a first installation with locally installed third party
support softwares:

0. Install third party support softwares:
 -- LaTeX distribution
 -- Pari 2.5 or up (http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/).
 -- Maxima 5.20 or up (http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/) (check that maxima-share
    is installed).
 -- Libgd 2.1 or up (http://libgd.bitbucket.org/).
 -- Make sure that the server is able to send mail.
 -- Check that you have the gnu utilities tac, date (with option -d), stat (with option -c)
   (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils)

1. Create a user, say `wims', with home directory, say, /var/wims ($HOME).

2. Login as wims, and copy the tar file wims-4.21e.tgz into $HOME.
   This tarball now contains the base system. It does not contains "pedagogical modules".

3. Decompress and untar the .tgz file.

4. (For a first installation only).
 Compile the server as user wims : type './compile --mathjax --jmol --modules --swac --geogebra'
It takes a long time as there are many pedagogical modules.
 (For an update of the installation), do not use the option --modules
  './compile' --mathjax --jmol --swac'

--modules : load all the pedagogical modules (use it only at the first installation)
--jmol : load/upgrade jsmol (used in some chemical modules) (http://jmol.org/index.php/JSmol)
--swac : load some audios (take a long time. do it only at the first installation). (http://shtooka.net)
--geogebra : load/upgrade geogebraweb (https://www.geogebra.org/)

 In case of compilation difficulty, you can try to change the line
 ./configure || exit
in the file compile by
 ./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib || exit
or some suitable path.

At the end, you will be asking about the IP address from which the webmaster will
be able to configure the preferences, his password and the wims email address.
Then execute the script ./bin/setwrapexec as root. It is important
for security reasons.

5. Get and install optional support software. Omitting some of them will simply
 prevent your server from running some of the exercises / activities.

 -- GNU Octave 3.0.4 or up (http://www.octave.org/).        ( 20% importance)
 -- Yacas 1.0.52 or up (http://yacas.sourceforge.net/).     ( 10% importance)
 -- GAP 4 or up (http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~gap).     ( 10% importance)
 -- Povray (http://www.povray.org/).                        (  5% importance)
 -- Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/).                    (  5% importance)
 -- Macaulay (1.1 or up)                                    (~ 0% importance)
 -- fortune and strfile
 -- openbabel (openbabel.org)

6. You may run WIMS single-user by executing the script $HOME/localwims
   if you would prefer something else. In this case, you must run first the
   script ./bin/setwimsd as root. It is important for security reasons.

   The default browser used is mozilla, call 'localwims another_browser'
   if you would prefer something else. **untested now**
   You should see your favorite browser pop up and display the WIMS home page,
   including a link allowing you to do online site maintenance. Click on it
   and follow instructions there to configure and check your installation.

   In particular, modules must be selected and installed from that online
   maintenance page.

7. If you want to use Apache httpd with WIMS, run $HOME/bin/apache-config
   as root. In this case, wims can be accessed from the address

	  http://localhost/wims/
	or
	  http://localhost/wims/wims.cgi

9. You can make more configuration (from the WIMS home page, follow the link maintenance).

10. To be able to use the W3C validation, install the perl package
WebService-Validator-HTML-W3C

For a further installation, execute the script bin/server-interrupt,
go to steps 2, 3 and 4. and execute the script bin/server-resume

#######################

If you want to use a safe execution environment on 64bit Linux
(using a chroot-directory : build on gcc version 6.1.1 20160707)
containing all essential software, follow the next steps :

1. Create a user, say `wims', with home directory, say, /var/wims ($HOME).

2. Login as wims, and copy the tar file wims-4.21e.tgz into $HOME.
   This tarball now contains the base system. It does not contains "pedagogical modules".

3. Decompress and untar the .tgz file.

4. (For a first installation only). Get and execute the script wims_modules.pl
(need Perl and webget). It takes a long time as there are many pedagogical modules.

5. Download for 64bit linux the complete chroot archive
https://wims.unice.fr/download/wims/chroot/wims-4.12.chroot64.linux.tar.bz2
Decompress and untar as user wims (in $HOME).

6. Compile the server as user wims : type './compile --build-chroot'.
At the end, you will be asking about the IP address from which the webmaster will
configure the preferences, the password he will have and the wims email address.
Then execute the script './bin/setchroot' as root.

7. Run $HOME/bin/apache-config as root. In this case, wims can be accessed from the address
http://localhost/wims/
 or
http://localhost/wims/wims.cgi

8. You can make more configuration (from the WIMS home page, follow the link maintenance).

For a further installation, you have only to do the step 2, 3 and 6.

Good luck, and enjoy!
